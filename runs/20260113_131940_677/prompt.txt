Create a GE Appliances-branded web application that analyzes employee timesheet CSV data to identify top and bottom performers based on punctuality and work duration adherence to a 9-5 schedule. The app should feature a clean, professional interface with GE's signature blue and white color scheme.

Core functionality:
- Drag-and-drop CSV file upload with visual feedback and validation for required columns (employee_name, date, clock_in_time, clock_out_time)
- Real-time processing indicator while analyzing data
- Performance dashboard showing:
  - Top performer card with name, punctuality score (percentage of days arrived by 9:00 AM), average daily hours, and explanation highlighting consistent on-time arrivals
  - Bottom performer card with name, punctuality score, average daily hours, and explanation citing frequent late arrivals or early departures
- Sortable employee table showing all workers with their scores, total days worked, and average hours
- Exportable PDF report generation

UI specifications:
- Responsive design that works seamlessly on desktop tablets and mobile devices
- High contrast mode toggle for accessibility compliance
- Keyboard navigation support throughout the interface
- Screen reader-friendly table structure with proper ARIA labels
- Loading states with descriptive text for visual impairments
- Clear error messaging for invalid file formats or missing data

Visual elements:
- Progress ring charts showing punctuality percentages for top/bottom performers
- Bar chart comparing average daily hours across employees
- Color-coded indicators (green for good performance, yellow for caution, red for poor performance)
- Consistent use of GE's typography and spacing standards

The app should process the CSV to calculate punctuality based on 9:00 AM arrival time, flag any days with less than 8 hours worked, and provide clear, data-driven explanations for performance rankings while maintaining employee privacy through aggregated data display.
