Build a responsive web app for GE Appliances managers that ingests a two-week CSV timesheet and instantly surfaces the best- and worst-performing employees based on punctuality relative to a fixed 09:00–17:00 shift. The experience must be accessible (WCAG 2.2 AA), mobile-first, and on-brand—clean whites, subtle appliance-steel greys, GE red for primary actions, 16 px base font, 8-point spacing grid.

1. Landing screen  
   - Large “Upload Timesheet” drop zone with drag-and-drop, click-to-browse, and keyboard activation.  
   - Visually hidden label tied to input for screen readers.  
   - Accepts only .csv; validates MIME type and column headers (employee_id, name, date, clock_in, clock_out).  
   - Inline error banner if headers missing or malformed; success toast when file accepted.

2. Processing & progress  
   - After validation, parse with PapaParse in a web worker to keep UI snappy; show determinate progress bar.  
   - Compute for each employee:  
     – Avg minutes late to clock-in (09:00 target)  
     – Avg minutes early/late to clock-out (17:00 target)  
     – Total shift length deviation (ideal = 8 h)  
     – Consistency score (lower std-dev = better)  
   - Weighted composite score: 40 % punctuality-in, 30 % punctuality-out, 30 % consistency.  
   - Return best (highest score) and worst (lowest score) employees plus a one-sentence plain-language explanation generated from predefined templates, e.g., “Jordan Lee logged in within 1 min of 9 AM every day and averaged 8 h 1 min per shift, beating peers by 5 %.”

3. Results dashboard  
   - Hero card at top: employee photo placeholder, name, badge “Best Performer” or “Needs Improvement,” score badge.  
   - Stacked bar below compares best vs worst across three metrics; use high-contrast palette with data labels and aria-describedby for each bar.  
   - Compact data table lists all employees ranked by score; sortable columns with aria-sort.  
   - Each row expandable to daily detail (timeline chart) built with D3—x-axis = date, y-axis = minutes deviation from 09:00/17:00; zero-line highlighted; tooltips on hover/focus; keyboard-navigable points.

4. Export & next steps  
   - Primary button “Download Report” generates PDF (landscape) containing summary paragraph, hero cards, and full table; tagged for accessibility.  
   - Secondary button “Upload New File” returns user to landing screen; previous file cached in session storage until explicitly cleared.

5. Responsive behaviour  
   - ≤ 600 px: single-column cards, stacked bar becomes vertical bullet chart, data table horizontally scrollable with sticky first column.  
   - ≥ 601 px: two-column dashboard layout, table fits viewport.

6. Accessibility extras  
   - Focus outline 3 px GE red.  
   - All charts use <title> and <desc> elements; summary data mirrored as hidden screen-reader text.  
   - Colour-blind safe palette (ColorBrewer Set2) with shape or pattern redundancy.  
   - Supports system motion-reduced preference by disabling animated transitions.

Deliver a React/TypeScript component library with Storybook stories for each state (idle, uploading, error, success) and Jest tests achieving ≥ 90 % coverage. Provide a FastAPI Python microservice endpoint /analyze that accepts multipart CSV and returns JSON with best/worst objects and ranking array; include OpenAPI spec and unit tests.
