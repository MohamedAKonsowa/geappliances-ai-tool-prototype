  "title": "Timesheet Performance Analyzer – No Startup Popup",
  "description": "A client‑side GE Appliances internal tool that lets users upload a CSV timesheet, computes punctuality against a 9 am‑5 pm schedule, identifies the best and worst performers, and provides on‑demand explanations. The modal explanation dialog is hidden on page load and only appears when the user clicks a \"Why?\" button, eliminating any unexpected popup at startup.",
  "pages": [

      "name": "Home",
      "purpose": "Upload CSV, view summary cards, bar chart, and employee metrics table."

  "interactions": [
    "User drags a CSV onto the upload zone or clicks it to open the file picker; the hidden input receives the file.",
    "On file selection, validate that the file is a CSV; show a SweetAlert2 error toast if invalid.",
    "When a valid CSV is chosen, set loading=true, parse with PapaParse (header:true, skipEmptyLines:true), then set loading=false.",
    "For each row, compute lateMins = max(0, minutes between clock_in and 09:00) and earlyMins = max(0, minutes between 17:00 and clock_out).",
    "Aggregate per employee: average late minutes, average early‑leave minutes, totalDeviation = avgLateMins + avgEarlyMins.",
    "Identify bestEmployee (minimum totalDeviation) and worstEmployee (maximum totalDeviation).",
    "Persist the employees array and theme in localStorage; on page load, loadStoredData() restores them and keeps showExplanationModal false.",
    "Render Best and Worst cards with metrics and a \"Why?\" button.",
    "Clicking a \"Why?\" button sets modalEmployee, modalType, calls window.geaRuntimeLLM with a prompt containing that employee’s metrics, stores the result in explanationText (fallback to templated text on failure), and sets showExplanationModal=true.",
    "The modal can be closed via the X button, clicking outside the dialog, or pressing Escape; closing sets showExplanationModal=false and clears modalEmployee, modalType, and explanationText.",
    "Chart.js bar chart displays totalDeviation for each employee; the bar for bestEmployee is colored green, worstEmployee red.",
    "Simple‑DataTables provides column sorting, pagination, and a search box for the employee table; row clicks do not trigger the modal.",
    "Dark‑mode toggle updates the Tailwind dark class, stores the preference, and changes the toggle icon.",
    "Reset button clears all stored data (employees, theme) from localStorage and reloads the page to the initial state."
  ],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Upload zone accepts CSV via drag‑and‑drop or click‑to‑browse; hidden file input is correctly triggered.",
    "Non‑CSV files produce a clear error toast and do not crash the app.",
    "CSV parsing completes without errors; employee metrics table populates correctly.",
    "Average lateness and early‑leave are calculated in minutes with two‑decimal precision.",
    "Best Performer card shows the employee with the smallest total deviation; Worst Performer card shows the largest.",
    "Explanation modal is hidden on page load and only appears after the user clicks a \"Why?\" button.",
    "Modal displays a concise natural‑language explanation generated by the LLM or a fallback template.",
    "Bar chart shows a bar for each employee; best performer bar is green, worst performer bar is red.",
    "Employee table columns are sortable, searchable, and paginated; clicking rows does not open the modal.",
    "Dark‑mode toggle works, persists across reloads, and updates all UI components.",
    "All computed data and theme preference are saved in localStorage; refreshing the page restores the previous analysis without showing any modal.",
    "No external network requests are made except for loading permitted CDN libraries; all CSV processing runs client‑side.",
    "UI complies with GE Appliances accessibility standards: keyboard‑navigable, ARIA labels on interactive elements, sufficient color contrast."
