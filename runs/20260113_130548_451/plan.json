  "title": "Timesheet Performance Analyzer – Revised",
  "description": "A client‑side GE Appliances internal tool that lets users upload a CSV timesheet, computes punctuality against a 9 am‑5 pm schedule, identifies the best and worst performers, and explains the results. Updated to eliminate the unexpected modal popup and make the explanation dialog open only on explicit user actions.",

    "User clicks or drags a CSV onto the upload zone → drop area forwards the event to the hidden file input and prevents default browser handling.",
    "On file selection, validate MIME type and extension; if invalid, show a SweetAlert2 error toast.",
    "When a valid CSV is chosen, display a loading overlay, parse the file with PapaParse (header: true, skipEmptyLines: true).",
    "For each row, compute lateMins = max(0, minutes between clock_in and 09:00) and earlyMins = max(0, minutes between 17:00 and clock_out).",
    "Aggregate per employee: average late minutes, average early‑leave minutes, totalDeviation = avgLate + avgEarly.",
    "Determine bestEmployee (minimum totalDeviation) and worstEmployee (maximum totalDeviation).",
    "Persist the computed employees array in localStorage (key: timesheetEmployees) so a page refresh retains the analysis.",
    "Render Best and Worst cards with name, avgLate, avgEarly, totalDeviation, and a \"Why?\" button.",
    "When a \"Why?\" button is clicked, set modalEmployee to the corresponding employee, call window.geaRuntimeLLM with a prompt that includes that employee’s metrics, store the returned text in explanationText (fallback to a templated explanation if LLM fails), and set showExplanationModal to true.",
    "The modal can be closed via the X button, clicking outside, or pressing Escape – all of which set showExplanationModal to false and clear modalEmployee/explanationText.",
    "Row clicks in the employee table no longer open the modal; they remain purely for visual selection.",
    "Create a Chart.js bar chart where each bar represents totalDeviation; color the best performer bar green and the worst performer red.",
    "Initialize Simple‑DataTables on the employee table, enabling column sorting, pagination, and a text search box.",
    "Theme toggle button switches Tailwind’s dark class, updates the stored theme, and changes the icon accordingly.",
    "Reset button clears localStorage for both data and theme, then reloads the page to the initial state."
  ],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "The upload zone accepts a CSV via drag‑and‑drop or by clicking to open the file picker; the hidden file input is triggered correctly.",
    "Invalid files (non‑CSV) produce a clear error toast and do not crash the app.",
    "CSV parsing completes without errors and populates the employee metrics table.",
    "Average lateness and early‑leave are calculated in minutes with two‑decimal precision.",
    "Best Performer card shows the employee with the smallest total deviation; Worst Performer card shows the largest.",
    "Explanation modal opens only after the user clicks a \"Why?\" button and displays a concise natural‑language explanation generated by the LLM or a fallback template.",
    "No modal appears automatically on page load or after file upload – the \"weird popup\" issue is resolved.",
    "Bar chart displays all employees; best performer bar is highlighted in green, worst in red.",
    "Table columns are sortable, searchable, and paginated; clicking a row does not trigger the modal.",
    "Dark‑mode toggle works, persists across reloads, and updates all UI components.",
    "All computed data and theme preference are saved in localStorage; refreshing the page restores the previous analysis.",
    "No external network requests are made except for loading permitted CDN libraries; all CSV processing runs client‑side.",
    "The UI meets GE Appliances accessibility standards: keyboard‑navigable, ARIA labels on interactive elements, sufficient color contrast."
