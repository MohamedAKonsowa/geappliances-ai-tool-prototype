Build a responsive web app for GE Appliances HR managers that ingests a CSV of employee timesheet data and instantly surfaces the most and least punctual employees over any selected date range.  Upload: drag-and-drop or file-picker accepting only .csv; show a progress bar and preview the first five rows before analysis.  Analysis engine: calculate arrival delta (clock_in – 09:00), departure delta (clock_out – 17:00), and daily minutes worked; rank employees by average arrival delta and flag any day with >5 min late arrival or >5 min early departure; compute a simple punctuality score (0–100) where 100 is perfect 09:00–17:00 adherence.  Results screen: two prominent GE-branded cards at top—“Most Punctual” and “Least Punctual”—with employee photo placeholder, name, ID, score, and a one-sentence plain-English explanation (“Jordan Lee averaged 1.2 min early and never left early”).  Below, sortable data table with badges (green check / red clock) for quick scanning and a responsive bar chart showing punctuality scores for the whole team; tooltip on hover gives exact minutes late/early.  Accessibility: full keyboard navigation, aria-labels on badges, color-blind friendly palette, and a toggle for high-contrast mode.  Responsive breakpoints: single-column mobile, two-column tablet, full desktop dashboard.  Export: “Download PDF Report” button that generates a GE-styled summary page with logo, date range, top/bottom performers, and chart.
