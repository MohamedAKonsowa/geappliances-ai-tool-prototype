Build a responsive web application for GE Appliances managers to analyze employee timesheet CSV data and automatically identify the best and worst performing employees based on punctuality and schedule adherence to a 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM standard. The app must open with a large, high-contrast “Upload CSV” drop-zone that accepts files up to 10 MB; on upload, parse the CSV client-side using PapaParse, validate required columns (employee_id, name, date, clock_in, clock_out), and show an inline error banner if any row is malformed. Once validated, compute for each employee: (a) average minutes late to clock-in after 9:00 AM, (b) average minutes early to clock-out before 5:00 PM, (c) total schedule deviation (sum of a+b). Display a clean, card-based dashboard with two prominent GE-blue hero cards at the top: “Best Performer – Most Punctual” (lowest total deviation) and “Needs Attention – Least Punctual” (highest total deviation). Each card must show the employee’s photo placeholder, name, average clock-in delta, average clock-out delta, and a plain-language explanation such as “Alex averaged 1 min late to arrive and left exactly on time, totaling 5 min deviation across 10 days.” Below the hero cards, render an accessible data table (sortable columns, aria-labels, keyboard-navigable) listing all employees with deviations; include a horizontal bar chart using Chart.js that visualizes total deviation in minutes for quick comparison. Provide a secondary filter bar to select date ranges and toggle between “All Employees” or “Single Employee View.” Ensure full responsive behavior: stack cards vertically on mobile, convert the table into a swipe-friendly list, and scale charts with CSS container queries. Include a “Download Report” button that exports a PDF (via jsPDF) containing the hero cards, chart, and table for the selected date range. Maintain WCAG 2.2 AA contrast, add focus outlines, and include an option to toggle larger fonts. Use GE’s official color palette: #003B64 for headers, #B1C2C4 for dividers, white cards with 2 px radius, and 16 px gutter. Keep micro-copy concise and action-oriented; all calculations must complete in under 1 second for 1,000 rows.
