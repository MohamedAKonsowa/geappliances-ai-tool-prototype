Create a GE Appliances-branded web app that ingests a CSV file containing employee time-clock data (columns: EmployeeID, Date, ClockIn, ClockOut), automatically detects the file schema, calculates daily hours worked against a 9-to-5 benchmark, and surfaces the single best-performing and single worst-performing employee for the uploaded period. Display a clean, responsive dashboard with a top banner that contains the GE logo, file-upload drop-zone, and date-range selector. Below that, render two side-by-side summary cards—one green for “Best Performer” and one red for “Worst Performer”—each showing employee name, average daily hours vs. 9-to-5 target, days on time, days late, days short, and a concise natural-language explanation of the ranking (e.g., “Sarah averaged 8.9 hrs/day, clocked in early 18 of 20 days, and left after 5 p.m. 17 times”). Include an accessible data table with sortable columns and high-contrast mode toggle. Provide a one-click “Export Report” button that downloads a PDF containing the summary cards and a time-card chart for each highlighted employee. Ensure keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and mobile-first responsive layout; cap file size at 10 MB and validate CSV structure before processing.
