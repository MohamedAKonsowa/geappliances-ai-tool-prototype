  ],
  "interactions": [
    "User selects a CSV file → Papa Parse reads the file into csvData.",
    "User clicks 'Analyze' button → set isLoading true, build a prompt with a preview of csvData (first 10 rows) and call window.geaRuntimeLLM(prompt).",
    "Receive LLM response → store in guessResult, set isLoading false, display result card.",
    "If parsing fails or LLM returns an error → set errorMessage and show SweetAlert2 toast.",
    "Cache last successful csvData and guessResult using window.geaRuntimeStore.set('lastCsv', {data, result}) so the app can restore state on reload."
  ],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "CSV file can be uploaded via file input; only .csv files accepted.",
    "File is parsed client‑side with Papa Parse; parsing errors are shown to the user.",
    "After clicking Analyze, a loading indicator appears while the LLM processes the request.",
    "The app calls window.geaRuntimeLLM with a prompt that includes a concise preview of the CSV (e.g., first 10 rows) and asks the model to guess the dataset's topic.",
    "The guessed topic is displayed in a readable card format.",
    "Errors from the LLM or parsing are shown using SweetAlert2.",
    "The UI is responsive and uses Tailwind/DaisyUI styling.",
    "Last successful analysis is persisted via window.geaRuntimeStore and restored on page reload."
