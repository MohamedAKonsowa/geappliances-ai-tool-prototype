Design an employee performance analysis app that accepts a CSV file containing timesheet data, analyzes the data, and displays the employee with the best and worst performance based on their clocked hours, assuming a standard 9-5 work schedule. The app should provide a clear explanation for the performance rankings.

The app's main screen should feature a file upload component, allowing users to select and upload their CSV file. A button to initiate the analysis should be prominently displayed. Once the analysis is complete, the app should display the results in a clean and easy-to-read format, using a combination of tables, charts, and graphs to visualize the data.

The results screen should include the following components: 
1. A table listing the top 3 performing employees, including their name, total hours worked, and average daily punctuality.
2. A table listing the bottom 3 performing employees, including their name, total hours worked, and average daily punctuality.
3. A bar chart comparing the total hours worked by each employee.
4. A line graph showing the average daily punctuality for each employee over the analyzed period.

To ensure accessibility, the app should follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines, including high contrast mode, screen reader support, and keyboard navigation. The app should also be fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices.

The analysis should consider the following factors:
- Total hours worked: Calculate the total hours worked by each employee, taking into account any deviations from the standard 9-5 schedule.
- Average daily punctuality: Calculate the average daily punctuality for each employee, considering both clock-in and clock-out times.
- Performance ranking: Rank employees based on their total hours worked and average daily punctuality, with the best performer being the one who has worked the most hours and has the highest average daily punctuality.

The app should provide a clear and concise explanation for the performance rankings, including the specific factors that contributed to each employee's ranking. This explanation should be displayed below the results tables and charts.

The app's UI should reflect the professional and clean branding of GE Appliances, using a minimalist design approach with a focus on functionality and usability. The color scheme should be limited to a palette of blues and whites, with clear and consistent typography throughout the app.

When the user uploads a new CSV file, the app should automatically initiate the analysis and update the results screen. If any errors occur during the analysis, the app should display a clear and concise error message, providing guidance on how to resolve the issue.

The app should also include a settings menu, allowing users to adjust the analysis parameters, such as the standard work schedule and the weighting of different performance factors. This menu should be accessible from the main screen and should include a save button to store the updated settings.

Overall, the app should provide a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for analyzing employee performance based on timesheet data, with a focus on clarity, accessibility, and responsiveness.
