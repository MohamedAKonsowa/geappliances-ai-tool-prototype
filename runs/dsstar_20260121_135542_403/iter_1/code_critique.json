  "fixInstructions": "Complete the script: add event listeners for #generate-btn, #copy-btn, #save-pdf-btn, #create-another-btn; finish generateStory() to call window.geaRuntimeLLM with a prompt using name1/name2, store result in state.story and window.geaRuntimeStore, toggle sections, implement copy-to-clipboard with isCopied state feedback, implement PDF generation with jsPDF, load last 5 stories from window.geaRuntimeStore on load, render them in #recent-stories cards, add try/catch around async operations and showToast errors, ensure loading overlay is shown/hidden appropriately, and keep all CDN scripts already present."
