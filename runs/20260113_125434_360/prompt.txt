Build a professional employee evaluation dashboard for GE Appliances that ingests two-week timesheet CSV files and produces actionable performance insights. The app opens to a minimalist landing page anchored by a prominent “Upload Timesheet” button styled in GE’s signature blue (#005CB9) with white Nunito-Sans label. After file selection, a thin progress bar animates left-to-right and announces status via aria-live region. Post-upload, the CSV is validated for required columns (employee_id, name, date, clock_in, clock_out) and checked for duplicates; any errors surface in an inline, high-contrast red alert with a downloadable error log. Valid data flows into a serverless worker that calculates per-employee metrics: total hours, average daily hours, days worked, punctuality score (on-time arrival within 5 min), and overtime threshold flag (>8 h). Results feed three synchronized views: (1) KPI cards across the top showing workforce totals, averages, and overtime count; (2) a sortable, responsive data table with sticky headers, row hover highlighting, and keyboard navigation that lists each employee’s consolidated stats; (3) a pair of accessible charts—an 8-bar horizontal chart ranking employees by total hours and a line chart plotting daily workforce totals—both using GE’s subdued palette (#005CB9, #6D6E71, #B1B3B3) with pattern fills for color-blind users and data labels readable at 200 % zoom. A persistent top nav offers “Dashboard”, “Details”, “Reports”; selecting “Reports” opens a print-optimized, paginated view where managers can generate individual PDF evaluations summarizing hours, punctuality, and overtime flags. The entire interface is responsive: stacking KPI cards into a single column under 768 px, transforming the data table into a card list, and swapping charts for accordions on screens <480 px. Dark-mode and high-contrast toggles live in the footer; all controls have aria-labels in English and Spanish, focus outlines meet WCAG 2.2 AA, and keyboard shortcuts (U for upload, R for report, / for search) are documented in an off-canvas help panel.
